# VictoryVoronoiTooltip

`VictoryVoronoiTooltip` renders a dataset as a voronoi overlay; a series of polygons optimized for the nearest data point. VictoryVoronoiTooltip behaves identically to [VictoryVoronoi], except that it uses [VictoryTooltip] as its default `labelComponent`. This results in tooltips that are easier to use due to much larger interactive areas. `VictoryVoronoiTooltip` is especially useful for adding tooltips to line charts and scatter plots.
