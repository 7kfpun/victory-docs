# Victory Recipes

We have a few recipes, or small cookbook, of how to customize and extend Victory to your needs! Play with the examples here or [go straight to the source](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-examples).

All recipes will assume a basic understanding of Victory. Recipes will typically start out as bare-bones examples and (ideally) mature into step-by-step walk-throughs.
